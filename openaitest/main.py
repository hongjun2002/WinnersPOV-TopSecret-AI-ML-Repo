Food needs improvement but that will come in time!!\n2.I brought my girlfriend to the er. she had fell down and I needed to bring her in. I dropped her off and went to park the truck. when I got to the ER the cop working the door wouldn't check me in so I couldn't be in there with her!!! this is outrageous and is in now way acceptable. we will not be returning to your hospital and I will have our baby elsewhere!\n3.Super friendly staff and I saw the Doctor right away.\n4.I’m in the hospital & I’ve been told that my nurse will help me to the bathroom about 10 times but they won’t let me go. And soooorude\nWe had a great experience from start to finish. All the staff were exceptionally helpful & kind. The surgery went very well for my spouse. The stay was very comfortable~for both of us. Thank you for setting the standard of what a Hospital experience ought to be, and for the Get Well card for her too!!!!\n"
